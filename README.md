# Draw-A-Transit

This uses pygame (http://pygame.org) and matplotlib to let a user draw a limb-darkened star and a dark object, which is then moved in front of the star, producing a transit lightcurve and transit animation.
An example assymetric lightcurve (from WTF star KIC08462852, http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03622) is provided, prompting users to try to make the object fit the data.
The lightcurve and occulting body shape is then saved to file


Requisite modules: numpy,  matplotlib, pygame. os
